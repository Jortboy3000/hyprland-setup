This script takes your fresh Arch install and give you a good foundation to build upon!
##  What You Get

- **Swww** - Wallpaper engine for the sophisticated
- **Perfect keybinds** - Actually usable, not some vim wizard nonsense

## Features

### Visual Candy

- Rounded corners everywhere (because we're not animals)
- Glassmorphism vibes
- Color scheme that doesn't burn your retinas

### Actually Functional
- Smart workspace management
- Screenshot tools that work
- Audio controls that make sense
- Brightness keys (shocking, I know)
- Auto-wallpaper setup

### Quality of Life

## Installation

**One command. That's it.**

```bash
curl -L -o hyprland-setup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jortboy3000/hyprland-setup/main/hyprland-setup.sh" && chmod +x hyprland-setup.sh && ./hyprland-setup.sh
```

Then reboot and watch the magic happen.

## Essential Keybinds

| Keys | Action | 
|------|--------|
| `Super + Enter` | Open terminal |
| `Super + D` | App launcher |
| `Super + Q` | Close window |
| `Super + 1-5` | Switch workspace |
| `Super + Shift + 1-5` | Move window to workspace |
| `Super + Arrow Keys` | Move focus |
| `Super + Print` | Screenshot area |
| `Print` | Screenshot everything |

## Customization

Want to make it yours? 

- **Wallpapers**: Drop them in `~/Pictures/wallpapers/`
- **Colors**: Edit `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`
- **Bar**: Tweak `~/.config/waybar/style.css`
- **Terminal**: Mess with `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`

## Requirements

- Arch Linux (obviously)
- Internet connection
- About 5 minutes
- Willingness to flex on Ubuntu users

## Troubleshooting

**Script won't run?**
```bash
chmod +x hyprland-setup.sh
```

**Looks broken after reboot?**
- Check if you're on TTY1 (Hyprland auto-starts there)
- Try `Super + Enter` to open terminal

**Want your old setup back?**
- Your configs are backed up in `~/.config/hyprland-setup-backup-*`
